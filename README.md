## Introduction
This project involves developing a Python program to simulate dynamic processes under varying load conditions. The focus is on detecting system bottlenecks and analyzing how load changes impact task efficiency and resource allocation.

## Project Task
  # 1. Data Import and Cleaning
   - Import dynamic simulation data from a CSV file.
   - Remove incomplete or invalid rows (e.g., rows with negative values).
  # 2. Dynamic Load Analysis
   - Analyze task efficiency under varying load levels (low, medium, high).
   - Identify tasks with the highest delays during peak load conditions.
  # 3. Resource Bottleneck Detection
   - Calculate average and peak resource utilization.
   - Detect bottlenecks by comparing task completion times under different load conditions.
  # 4. Visualization
   - Line Chart: Task completion times under low, medium, and high load conditions.
   - Heatmap: Resource usage intensity across task categories.
   - Bar Chart: Peak delays for different task categories.

 ## Tools and Libraries
  - Python: Programming language for implementation.
  - Pandas: For data import, cleaning, and manipulation.
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
  - NumPy: For efficient numerical operations.

 ## How to Run the Project
  - Install required libraries
  - Place the CSV file containing dynamic simulation data in the project directory.
  - Run the Python script with (.py)
  - Follow the interactive console prompts for data analysis and visualization.

 ## Conclusion 
 This project provides an analytical framework to simulate and evaluate dynamic processes, detect bottlenecks, and optimize resource allocation. By leveraging Python's data handling and visualization libraries, it offers actionable insights for improving task efficiency under varying load conditions.
